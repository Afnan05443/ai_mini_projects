# AI Mini Projects (Afnan)

This repo contains three beginner-friendly projects:

1. *Student Grade Predictor* (Logistic Regression, scikit-learn)  
2. *Weather Mood Analyzer* (Open-Meteo API + Python)  
3. *AI Loan Approver* (Random Forest, scikit-learn)

## How to run
- Open the .ipynb files in Google Colab and run all cells.
- Python libs: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, requests (Colab preinstalls these).

## Results (samples)
- Grade Predictor: ~0.85–0.92 accuracy on test split.  
- Loan Approver: ~0.90+ accuracy on synthetic data.  
- Weather Mood: prints current weather + mood label.
